# PuttingABugInML
This repository contains the code used in the paper "Putting a bug in ML: The moth olfactory network learns to read MNIST", by CB Delahunt and JN Kutz, January 2018

Status: We're currently refactoring the Matlab code base for easier use. We expect to upload clean code before 30 April 2018.

If you have questions or comments, or wish access to material not yet posted, please email Charles Delahunt at delahunt@uw.edu, or find us at ICLR.

Thank you!
